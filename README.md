In Record Player, users will be able to:
    { Listen to Music }
    { Pause, speed up, slow down, and change the song}
    { move the needle to change what the song is playing }
    { rewind the music by dragging record}

I dont really plan on using any data APIs, if anything I will try to get an API that
has access to music and sound effects.
